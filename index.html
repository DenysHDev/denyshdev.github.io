                        <p>A command-line application written in Go that simulates the movement of trains between stations along the shortest possible routes. This project reads a network map from a file, represented as a graph using an adjacency list, and identifies the minimal number of turns required to move trains from a start station to an end station. The pathfinder uses a modified BFS algorithm to find the shortest paths, filtering for unique routes, and assigns trains to the best paths based on a scoring system. The simulation iteratively moves trains until all reach their destination, displaying each movement turn-by-turn. This project demonstrates efficient pathfinding and train scheduling in a fixed-block rail system. <b>Please note that my GitHub repository for this project is private as requested by Kood/Sisu.
