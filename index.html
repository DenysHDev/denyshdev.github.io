This platform allows users to create posts, categorize them, interact through comments, and use like/dislike features. It leverages SQLite for data management and includes Dockerization for efficient deployment. Registered users can authenticate with encrypted passwords, create and comment on posts, and filter content by categories and user preferences. The project was a group effort, where I primarily focused on backend development, and was completed with minimal use of JavaScript.

                        <p>A command-line application written in Go that simulates the movement of trains between stations along the shortest possible routes. This project reads a network map from a file, represented as a graph using an adjacency list, and identifies the minimal number of turns required to move trains from a start station to an end station. The pathfinder uses a modified BFS algorithm to find the shortest paths, filtering for unique routes, and assigns trains to the best paths based on a scoring system. The simulation iteratively moves trains until all reach their destination, displaying each movement turn-by-turn. This project demonstrates efficient pathfinding and train scheduling in a fixed-block rail system. Please note that my GitHub repository for this project is private as requested by Kood/Sisu.
